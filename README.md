# Harvard-CS50-Introduction-to-Computer-Science

All files from the Harvard University's course - [CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) that I've gone through so far.

The repository contains all examples from the lectures (directories named w1-w7), my solutions to the problem sets and [additional practice problems](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/practice/).

Each week's topics and short descriptions of the problems are as follows:

-   [mario-more](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/mario/more/) - a program that recreates the Mario pyramid, using hashes (\#) for bricks

-   [credit](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/credit/) - a program that checks the validity of a given credit card number

-   [plurality](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/3/plurality/) - a program that runs a plurality election (whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election)

-   [tideman](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/3/tideman/) - a program to simulate an election by the Tideman voting method

### [Week 4: Memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/4/)

Problem Set 4:

-   [volume](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/volume/) - a program that modifies the volume of an audio file

-   [filter-more](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/) - a program that allows the user to apply grayscale, reflection, blur, or edge detection filters to the images (functions implemented in *helpers.c*)

-   [recover](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/recover/) - a program that recovers JPEGs from a memory card

### [Week 5: Data Structures](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/5/)

Problem Set 5:

-   [inheritance](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/5/inheritance/) - a program that creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member (simulates the inheritance of blood types)

-   [speller](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/5/speller/) - a program that spell-checks a file using a hash table

### [Week 6: Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/6/)

Problem Set 6:

-   [hello](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/6/hello/) - a program that prompts the user for their name and then says hello to that user

-   [mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/6/mario/more/) - a program that recreates the Mario pyramid, using hashes (\#) for bricks

-   [credit](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/6/credit/) - a program that checks the validity of a given credit card number
