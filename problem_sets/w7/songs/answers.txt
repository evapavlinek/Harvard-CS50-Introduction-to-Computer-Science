Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the
average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s
top 100 songs from the past year.

If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura?

I would say that this person's audio aura is mostly purple.


Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not
be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

We could consider other variables as well, such as loudness, speechiness and tempo.
We could also include more than just top 100 songs, or perhaps include some way of normalisation
based on the number of the listening times where more listened songs would contribute
more to the audio aura.
